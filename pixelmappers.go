// PixelMapper is a function that takes the coordinate and color of a pixel,

// palette.
//
// This is used for thresholding, random dithering, patterning, and
// ordered dithering - basically any dithering that can be applied to each pixel
// individually.
//
// The provided RGB values are in the linear RGB space, and the returned values
// must be as well. All dithering operations should be happening in this space
// anyway, so this is done as a convenience. The RGB values are in the range
// [0, 65535], and must be returned in the same range.
//
// It must be thread-safe, as it will be called concurrently.

// RandomNoiseGrayscale returns a PixelMapper that adds random noise to the
// color before returning. This is the simplest form of dithering.
//
// Non-grayscale colors will be converted to grayscale before the noise is added.
//
// You must call rand.Seed before calling using the PixelMapper, otherwise the
// output will be the same each time. A simple way to initialize rand.Seed is:
//
//     rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
//
// The noise added to each channel will be randomly chosen from within the range
// of min (inclusive) and max (exclusive). To simplify things, you can consider
// valid color values to range from 0 to 1. This means if you wanted the noise to
// shift the color through 50% of the color space at most, the min and max would be
// -0.5 and 0.5.
//
// Statistically, -0.5 and 0.5 are the best values for random dithering, as they
// evenly dither colors. Using values closer to zero (like -0.2 and 0.2) will
// effectively reduce the contrast of the image, and values further from zero
// (like -0.7 and 0.7) will increase the contrast.
//
// Making the min and max different values, like using -0.2 and 0.5 will make
// the image brighter or darker. In that example, the image will become brighter,
// as the randomness is more likely to land on the positive side and increase the
// color value.
//
// If the noise puts the channel value too high or too low it will be clamped,
// not wrapped. Basically, don't worry about the values of your min and max
// distorting the image in an unexpected way.

// Bayer returns a PixelMapper that applies a Bayer matrix with the specified size.
// Please read this entire documentation, and see my recommendations at the end,
// especially if you're dithering color images.
//
// First off, cache the result of this function. It's not trivial to generate,
// and it can be re-used or used concurrently with no issues.
//
// The provided dimensions of the bayer matrix can only be powers of 2, but they do
// not need to be the same. If they are not powers of two this function will panic.
//
// There are currently two exceptions to this, which come from hand-derived Bayer
// matrices by Joel Yliluoma: 5x3, 3x5, 3x3. As he notes, "they can have a visibly
// uneven look, and thus are rarely worth using".
//
// Source:

//
// strength should be in the range [-1, 1]. It is multiplied with 65535
// (the max color value), which is then multiplied with the matrix.
//
// You can use this to change the amount the matrix is applied to the image, the
// "strength" of the dithering matrix. Usually just keeping it at 1.0 is fine.
//
// The closer to zero strength is, the smaller the range of colors that will be
// dithered. Colors outside that range will just be quantized, and not have a Bayer matrix
// applied. To dither the entire color range, set it to 1.0.
//
// Why would you want to shrink the dither range? Well Bayer matrixes are fundamentally
// biased to making the image brighter, increasing the value in each channel. This means
// that there might be darker parts that would be better off just quantized to the darkest
// color in your palette, instead of made lighter and dithered. By shrinking the dither
// range, you dither the colors that are more in the "middle", and let the darker and
// lighter ones just get quantized.
//
// You might also want to reduce the strength to reduce noise in the image, as dithering
// doesn't produce smooth colored areas. Usually a value around 0.8 is good for this.
//
// You can also make strength negative. If you know already that your image is dark, and so
// you don't want it to be made bright, then this is a better approach then shrinking the
// dither range. A negative strength flips the bias of the Bayer matrix, making it biased
// towards making images darker. To dither the entire color range but inverted, set strength
// to -1.0.
//
// The closer to zero you get, the more similar the effect of the negative and positive
// strength become. This is because they are shrinking the dither range towards the same spot.
//
// At Bayer sizes above 4x4, the brightness bias mostly disappears, and the difference
// between strength being -1.0 vs 1.0 is not really noticeable. Decreasing it below 1.0 or
// or above -1.0 will still shrink the dithering range, but instead of fixing some bias,
// it will just increase the contrast of the image.
//
// Greater than 1 or less than -1  doesn't really make sense, so stay away from that range.
// It expands the range of the dithering outside the possible color range, so there won't be
// enough dithering patterns in the output image. The further from zero, the larger the range.
//
// Going away from zero is similar to reducing contrast. If you go too far from zero, the
// whole image becomes gray.
//
// RECOMMENDATIONS
//
// For grayscale output, I would recommend 1.0 for lighter images, or -1.0 for darker images.
// If you cannot know beforehand, you may want to decrease that value, to reduce the risk of
// making dark images really bright. Try staying between 0.5 and 1.0.
//
// If you're using a Bayer size larger than 4x4, just using 1.0 for strength should be fine
// for most kinds of grayscale images.
//
// Color images are different. The Bayer matrix's bias to brightness applies to each RGB
// channel, and so the color of the image can become quite distorted at 1.0 strength.
// Several sites I have seen recommend 0.64 strength (written as 256/4), and from my own
// testing this is often a good value for color images. Do not default to 1.0 for Bayer
// dithering of color images.
//
// Of course, experiment for yourself. And let me know if I'm wrong!
